# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs must first be converted into bits of functionality that you can actually create within the project. User stories help by doing just that, it breaks the overall goal of the project into small pieces that can be used to develop unit tests. Once the tests are created, all that's left is to create code that passes all of the tests and the user's needs have been implemented.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I develop programs by first planning out its internal structure, then I plan out what each function should do. Once that's done, I move into an adaptive aproach where I try to implement my plan as best as I can, testing each functionality as I go, until I run into a problem. At that point, I go back and change my plan fix the problem, and then return to coding. I like agile's idea that unit tests are created before the implementation, and I hope to become more familiar with testing so that I can incorporate that idea in the future.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I haven't worked in many teams so I can only speculate, but I would naturally assume that you can't be a good team member without good communication. I would also suspect that a good team member has trust in the rest of their team, trust that they can accomplish the tasks requried of them without looking over their shoulder all of the time. Lastly, it would really help the team if your code didn't look like radioactive waste.
